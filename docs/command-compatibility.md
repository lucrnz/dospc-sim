## Command Details

### DIR Command

**Syntax:** `DIR [path] [/W] [/A]`

**Switches:**
- `/W` - Wide format (5 columns)
- `/A` - Show all files including hidden

**Output Format:**
```
 Volume in drive C is DOSPC-SIM
 Directory of C:\

01/15/2026  10:30 AM    <DIR>          DOCS
01/15/2026  10:30 AM    <DIR>          GAMES
01/15/2026  10:30 AM               256 README.TXT
               1 File(s)            256 bytes
               2 Dir(s)    52,428,800 bytes free
```

### COPY Command

**Syntax:** `COPY source destination`

**Notes:**
- Single file and wildcard (`*`, `?`) copy supported
- Supports relative and absolute paths
- Automatically handles directory destinations

### DEL/ERASE Command

**Syntax:** `DEL filespec [/Q]`

**Features:**
- Wildcard support: `*` (any chars) and `?` (single char)
- `/Q` - Quiet mode (no confirmation)

**Examples:**
- `DEL *.TXT` - Delete all .txt files
- `DEL FILE?.DAT` - Delete FILE1.DAT, FILE2.DAT, etc.

### CD/CHDIR Command

**Syntax:** `CD [path]`

**Features:**
- `CD` alone shows current directory
- Supports `..` (parent directory)
- Supports absolute paths from C:\

### EDIT Command

**Syntax:** `EDIT [filename]`

**Features:**
- Full-screen text editor using alternate screen buffer
- Arrow keys, Home/End, PgUp/PgDn navigation
- Ctrl+S to save, Ctrl+Q to quit (also Ctrl+C), Ctrl+O to open, Ctrl+A to save as
- Escape key shows help overlay
- Tab inserts 4 spaces
- Line numbers displayed in editor
- Unsaved changes warning on quit

### PROMPT Command

**Syntax:** `PROMPT [string]`

**Meta-characters:**
- `$P` - Current path
- `$G` - `>` character
- `$L` - `<` character
- `$D` - Current date
- `$T` - Current time
- `$N` - Drive letter
- `$$` - Literal `$`

### IF Command (Batch)

**Syntax:**
- `IF [NOT] EXIST name command [ELSE command]` (checks files and directories)
- `IF [NOT] ERRORLEVEL number command [ELSE command]`
- `IF [NOT] string1==string2 command [ELSE command]`
- `IF [NOT] DEFINED variable command [ELSE command]`

### FOR Command (Batch)

**Syntax:** `FOR %%var IN (set) DO command`

**Notes:**
- Variable replacement is case-insensitive; both `%%F` and `%%f` work reliably

**Example:**
```
FOR %%F IN (file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt) DO TYPE %%F
```

### START Command

**Syntax:** `START /B [/ID:name] command [args...]`

**Switches:**
- `/B` - Run in background (required in this environment; standard WinNT)
- `/ID:name` - Assign a human-readable job name (DOS+ extension)

**Notes:**
- Without `/ID`, jobs are auto-named `JOB1`, `JOB2`, etc.
- Background jobs run in separate threads with captured stdout/stderr
- Job table maximum is 64 entries
- Shell returns immediately with `%ERRORLEVEL%` = 0

### JOBS Command (DOS+)

**Syntax:** `JOBS [/V] [/PURGE]`

**Switches:**
- `/V` - Verbose: include thread ID, start time, and command
- `/PURGE` - Remove completed/killed/failed jobs from the table

### WAIT Command (DOS+)

**Syntax:** `WAIT jobid [/T:seconds]` or `WAIT /ALL [/T:seconds]`

**Switches:**
- `/ALL` - Wait for all running jobs
- `/T:n` - Timeout in seconds; continue on expiry (sets `%ERRORLEVEL%` = 2)

### KILL Command (DOS+)

**Syntax:** `KILL jobid [/F]` or `KILL /ALL [/F]`

**Switches:**
- `/ALL` - Terminate all running jobs
- `/F` - Force kill (mark as killed immediately)

### JOBOUT / JOBERR Commands (DOS+)

**Syntax:** `JOBOUT jobid [/TAIL] [/N:lines]` / `JOBERR jobid [/TAIL] [/N:lines]`

**Switches:**
- `/TAIL` - Follow output live until job ends
- `/N:n` - Print last n lines only

## Security Features

### User Isolation

1. **Home Directory Restriction**: Users cannot access files outside their home directory
2. **Path Validation**: All paths are resolved and validated against home directory
3. **Permission Errors**: Attempts to escape home directory result in "Access denied" errors
4. **Case-Insensitive Lookups**: All filesystem operations (read, write, rename, move, copy, delete) use case-insensitive path matching for DOS compatibility; multi-segment paths are resolved segment-by-segment

### C: Drive Mapping

Each user's home directory is mapped to C:\
- `C:\` = User's home directory
- Relative paths are relative to current directory
- `..` moves up within home directory only

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are available:

| Variable | Default Value | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `PROMPT` | `$P$G` | Command prompt string (evaluates to `C:\>` at root) |
| `PATH` | `C:\;C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS` | Search path for executables |
| `COMSPEC` | `C:\COMMAND.COM` | Command interpreter path |
| `TEMP` | `C:\TEMP` | Temporary directory |
| `TMP` | `C:\TEMP` | Temporary directory |

## Limitations and Known Issues

### Not Implemented

1. ~~**Background execution (`&`)**~~: Implemented via `START /B` and the DOS+ job management commands (`JOBS`, `WAIT`, `KILL`, `JOBOUT`, `JOBERR`)

## Interactive Shell Features

The SSH terminal session provides a full interactive line editor:

### Command History

- **Up/Down arrows** navigate through previously executed commands
- History is maintained per session

### Tab Completion

- **Command completion**: Typing a partial command name and pressing Tab completes it (or shows matching options)
- **Filename completion**: Tab-completes file and directory names, including paths with directory components
- **Batch file completion**: `.BAT` and `.CMD` files in the current directory are offered as completions
- **Shared command source**: SSH tab-completion and HELP command listings use a shared command metadata source, so command catalogs stay in sync

### Line Editing

- **Left/Right arrows** move the cursor within the current line
- **Home/End** jump to the beginning or end of the line
- **Delete** removes the character at the cursor
- **Backspace** removes the character before the cursor
- **Ctrl+C** cancels the current line and shows a new prompt
- **Ctrl+D** disconnects the session

## Standalone DOS Shell Entrypoint

The project now includes a standalone shell entrypoint:

- `uv run dos-shell` starts an interactive DOS shell rooted at the current working directory.
- `uv run dos-shell file.bat [args...]` executes a batch script and exits.
- If stdin is piped and no script argument is provided, stdin is interpreted as batch content and the process exits.
- Explicit stdin tokens are supported: `-` and `STDIN`.

Stdin and file batch execution paths both use the same parser+AST execution runtime.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:

- [ ] Additional commands: ATTRIB, XCOPY, DOSKEY
- [ ] Network drive simulation (NET USE)
